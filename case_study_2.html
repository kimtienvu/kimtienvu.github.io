          <h1>Case Study 2: Pomodoro Timer</h1>
          <h2>Background</h2>
          <p id="up_size">We’ve all been interrupted during a workflow at one point in our lives. It’s difficult to regain focus after getting 
            a text message from a friend or that one notification from your email or favorite social media site. Those small 
            interruptions add up and you lose precious time. It’s not only time you lose because of distractions but also the 
            time it takes for you to refocus.<br><br>

            The Pomodoro technique helps you plan out time to deal with those small interruptions and distractions without 
            taking away from your workflow. It allows you to put a pause on small distractions until you are at an appropriate 
            place to take a break and refocus your attention on handling that distraction. <br> <br>
          </p>

          <h5 id="up_size">
            It is often difficult to regain focus after being interrupted with a text message or notification from emails or social 
            media sites. Office workers need a way to stay productive and complete their tasks while dealing with distractions at an appropriate time
          </h5>
          <hr>
        </div>

        <div class="section-title">
          <h2>Planning and Development</h2>
          <p id="up_size">
            <b>Architectural Design Records:</b> Running a team requires a certain degree of trust and clarity. We established rules 
            written in a document stored in our repo that defines what is expected to be on the team and how to address situations 
            where rules are not followed. <br><br>

            Consensus may be reached via verbal interactions but preservation of these decisions are often lost over time particularly 
            if team members move on.  To address the erosion of shared understanding of decisions, our team documented key decisions 
            in the form of Architectural Decision Records (ADRs) which highlight general project plans, approaches, and why specific 
            design/coding decisions were made. This is all so that major decisions are recorded and understood for current and possibly 
            future team members to avoid organizational debt.

            <br><br><b>User Centered Thinking:</b> Our team created <i>User Stories</i> and <i>User Personas</i> to understand the needs
            and thoughts of an ideal user to ensure user centered design. Since the Pomodoro Timer is a web application that will most likely
            be used on a desktop, users need a way to get notified when to start a work session or when to take a break even if they are not looking
            at a screen. Since desktops do not have a vibration feature like on smart-devices, our team decided to implement different sound 
            notifications for different sessions. 
            
            <br><br><b>Comparative Analysis: </b> Before diving into code, our team researched core features of what a Pomodoro Timer should have and 
            which features we thought would be helpful to implement. Some sample findings are listed below and in summary, our team decided to Incorporate
            these features: 
            <ul id="up_size">
              <li><b>No need to pay to use a timer: </b> Everything is free! No need to pay for a premium version just to switch from light mode to dark mode for late night studying.</li>
              <li><b>Manual mode vs. Automatic:</b> Some users like being able to control when to start a work session or a break and most Pomodoro Timer Apps on the market have these buttons in plain sight
                however, some users may find this to be too tedious and don't want to think about changing sessions. Our app includes an "automatic mode" that will change sessions for the user so that they do not
                have to worry about it. Our Pomodoro Timer has both modes so users have a choice in the matter!</li>
              <li><b>Ability to change the time for each session: </b> Different Pomodoro techniques have different lengths of time for a work session or a break. We allow users to choose. </li>
            </ul>
            <h3> Competitors:
            </h3>
            <ul id="up_size">
              <li><b>Pomofocus: </b> Pomofocus had a lot of features that were not core features of a Pomodoro Timer like having a day streak for every consecutive
              day the user logged into the site and a ranking chart to compare different users depending on how much time they had to focus.</li>
              <li><b>TomatoTimer:</b> This timer web app is closer to centering around core features of a Pomodoro Timer and includes a few accessibility options like keyboard shortcuts and an FAQ section. </li>
              <li><b>TomatoTimers (tomatotimers.com) </b> This web app has a cute UI and includes both manual mode and a looping feature (our version of "automatic mode"). However, this timer includes a pause button which violates the Pomodoro Technique.
              Some nice features of this web app is that it includes a walkthrough of a Pomodoro Session to help users get started. </li>
            </ul>

            <div id ="up_size">
            <br><b>System Diagrams: </b>We created System diagrams on how our pomodoro timer web application will be decomposed. 
            We adopted the <i>C4 model</i> which provides a way for our development team to effectively communicate our software architecture
            at different levels. Level 1 describes the system context or "the bigger picture", level 2 shows how responsibilities are distributed across the system
            and how each container communicates with each other, and level 3 dives deeper by showing each component in a container and their interactions 
            with each other to make each component work.

          <br><br>
          <p id="up_size">We then drafted some designs for the Pomodoro Timer:</p>

          <p><i>Designs with color in light and dark mode.</i></p><br>


          <p id="up_size"><b>The goal: </b> Our team decided that our Pomodoro Timer would be a front-end web application implemented solely in vanilla JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. 
            The only third-party we used was for style, code quality checks, and automatic unit testing on the Pomodoro Timer’s GitHub page.</p>

        </div>

        <div class="section-title">
          <h2>Testing</h2>
          <p id="up_size"> Before any Pomodoro Timer updates could be deployed, the commit would need to pass our pipeline checks that check for code quality, 
            style enforcement violations, and failing unit tests. <br><br>
          
            <img class= "myImg" id="pipeline" src="assets/img/Pomodoro/Pipeline.PNG" alt="CI/CD Pipeline" style="width: 100%;">
            <br> <i>The CI/CD pipeline to guide the development process</i>
          
            <br><br><b>Bug Finds: </b>
            <ul id="up_size">
              <li><b>Sound Issues: </b> In manual mode, the sound would play when a session would start instead of when a session would end. This bug 
                was fixed by using a logic statement in the code to play a sound when a session finished instead of relying on when the CSS style c
                hanged.</li>
              <li><b>Dark Mode vs. Light Mode:</b> There was feedback that when a user chooses dark mode and they refresh the page, the page would load on 
                light mode and then switch to dark mode. This would be problematic if the user decided to use the Pomodoro Timer App in the dark where they 
                will be blinded by white light for a second before being encompassed by darkness once more. This bug was fixed by automatically loading the 
                application in dark mode and then switching to light mode if the user’s preference was originally light mode.</li>
              <li><b>Timer Tick is off by 1 second: </b> There was a bug where the timer would be off by 1 second (If the timer was set for 25 minutes, the alarm 
                would ring at 0:01 instead of 0:00). Our team decided that if the user chooses a time, to start the timer 1 second earlier so that the 
                timer would end at 0:00 (if the timer was set for 25 minutes, to change the timer text to 24:59 on start)</li>
            </ul>

            <div id="up_size"><b>Feature Update:</b> In our original design, our team decided not to implement a task list feature and focus solely on the timer aspect, however, 
            from user testing, a few comments we received was that the task list is considered a core feature of a Pomodoro Timer, therefore our team 
            decided to implement it. Additionally, it was brought to our attention that there should be a guide to show users how to use the different 
            features on the Pomodoro Timer Web Application. </div>
          
          </p>
          <img class= "myImg" id="task" src="assets/img/Pomodoro/ToDo.PNG" alt="Task List" style="height: 370px; width: 40%;">
          <img class= "myImg" id="tour" src="assets/img/Pomodoro/Help.PNG" alt="Help Guide" style="height: 370px; width: 40%;">
          <p><i>Incorporated a To-Do List and Tour-Guide.</i></p>

        </div>

        <div class="section-title">
          <h2>Accessibility</h2>
          <p id="up_size"> Our team wanted to increase user accessibility in our web application by addressing the following: 
            <ul id="up_size">
              <li><b>Visibility of System Status: </b> We implemented different color schemes for each of the three Pomodoro Sessions so that users know which session they are in.</li>
              <li><b>Match between system and the real world</b> We made sure that the wording in the help guide uses language that everyday users are familiar with.</li>
              <li><b>User Control and Freedom: </b> In the task list, users can bring back a task that was accidentally marked as "done".</li>
              <li><b>Consistency and Standards: </b> Navigation buttons like "Next" or "Back" in our help guide are in the same position so users do not get confused.</li>
              <li><b>Flexibility and Efficiency of Use: </b> Users who are new to the Pomodoro technique can opt to use "automatic mode" instead of "manual mode".</li>
              <li><b>Aesthetic and Minamalist Design: </b> Our UI only shows the core features of a Pomodoro Timer. Other features like switching from dark mode to light mode are hidden in the settings menu</li>
              <li><b>Help and Documentation: </b> Our help guide walks the user through using the Pomodoro Timer app.</li>
              <li><b>Google Lighthouse: </b> Google Lighthouse identifies and fixes common problems that affect a site's performance and addresses some accessibility issues. Running it via the Chrome Developer Tools displays different metrics that our team tried to increase. </li>
            </ul>

        <div class="section-title">

          <p id="up_size"><br><b>Reflection/Lessons learned</b> - From this project, I learned a lot about teamwork and communication. Our team was 
            composed of designers and programmers but one of the most important aspects was bridging the communication gap 
            between the Design team and the Coding team to make sure everyone understood what the future plans are and what 
            goals should be accomplished before a certain deadline.<br>

          <br><b>Future Plans: </b>If there was more time, some future features to think about would address more user accessibility. During the project,
          our team tried to address most of the user accessibility issues as outlined by Google Lighthouse. Some future plans include adding keyboard shortcuts to
          start and reset timer buttons, error messages or warning notifications when a user is about to violate a Pomodoro Session or double-check if a user wants to
        delete a task or move it to the "done" list.</p>
