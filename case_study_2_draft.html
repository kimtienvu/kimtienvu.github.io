          <h1>Case Study 2: Pomodoro Timer</h1>
          <h2>Background</h2>
          <p>We’ve all been interrupted during a workflow at one point in our lives. It’s difficult to regain focus after getting 
            a text message from a friend or that one notification from your email or favorite social media site. Those small 
            interruptions add up and you lose precious time. It’s not only time you lose because of distractions but also the 
            time it takes for you to refocus.<br><br>

            The Pomodoro technique helps you plan out time to deal with those small interruptions and distractions without 
            taking away from your workflow. It allows you to put a pause on small distractions until you are at an appropriate 
            place to take a break and refocus your attention on handling that distraction. <br> <br>
          </p>

            It is often difficult to regain focus after being interrupted with a text message or notification from emails or social 
            media sites. Office workers need a way to stay productive and complete their tasks while dealing with distractions at an appropriate time

          <h2>Planning and Development</h2>
          <p>
            <b>Architectural Design Records:</b> Running a team requires a certain degree of trust and clarity. We established rules 
            written in a document stored in our repo that defines what is expected to be on the team and how to address situations 
            where rules are not followed. <br><br>

            Consensus may be reached via verbal interactions but preservation of these decisions are often lost over time particularly 
            if team members move on.  To address the erosion of shared understanding of decisions, our team documented key decisions 
            in the form of Architectural Decision Records (ADRs) which highlight general project plans, approaches, and why specific 
            design/coding decisions were made. This is all so that major decisions are recorded and understood for current and possibly 
            future team members to avoid organizational debt.

            <br><br><b>User Centered Thinking:</b> Our team created <i>User Stories</i> and <i>User Personas</i> to understand the needs
            and thoughts of an ideal user to ensure user centered design.
            
            <br><br><b>Comparative Analysis: </b> Before diving into code, our team researched core features of what a Pomodoro Timer should have and 
            which features we thought would be helpful to implement - like Dark Mode for late night studying or a sound playing when a timer 
            was done.

            <br><br><b>System Diagrams: </b>We created System diagrams on how our pomodoro timer web application will be decomposed. 
            We adopted the <i>C4 model</i> which provides a way for our development team to effectively communicate our software architecture
            at different levels. Level 1 describes the system context or "the bigger picture", level 2 shows how responsibilities are distributed across the system
            and how each container communicates with each other, and level 3 dives deeper by showing each component in a container and their interactions 
            with each other to make each component work.

          <p><i>System diagrams help plan out the flow of the components that make up our web application.</i></p>
          <br><br>
          <p>We then drafted some designs for the Pomodoro Timer:</p>

          <p><i>Designs with color in light and dark mode.</i></p><br>


          <p><b>The goal: </b> Our team decided that our Pomodoro Timer would be a front-end web application implemented solely in vanilla JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. 
            The only third-party we used was for style, code quality checks, and automatic unit testing on the Pomodoro Timer’s GitHub page.</p>

        </div>

        <div class="section-title">
          <h2>Testing</h2>
          <p>Before any Pomodoro Timer updates could be deployed, the commit would need to pass our pipeline checks that check for code quality, 
            style enforcement violations, and failing unit tests. <br><br>
          
            <img src="assets/img/Pomodoro/Pipeline.PNG" alt="Wireframe" style="width: 100%;">
            <br> <i>The CI/CD pipeline to guide the development process</i>
          
            <br><br><b>Bug Finds: </b>
            <ul>
              <li><b>Sound Issues: </b> In manual mode, the sound would play when a session would start instead of when a session would end. This bug 
                was fixed by using a logic statement in the code to play a sound when a session finished instead of relying on when the CSS style c
                hanged.</li>
              <li><b>Dark Mode vs. Light Mode:</b> There was feedback that when a user chooses dark mode and they refresh the page, the page would load on 
                light mode and then switch to dark mode. This would be problematic if the user decided to use the Pomodoro Timer App in the dark where they 
                will be blinded by white light for a second before being encompassed by darkness once more. This bug was fixed by automatically loading the 
                application in dark mode and then switching to light mode if the user’s preference was originally light mode.</li>
              <li><b>Timer Tick is off by 1 second: </b> There was a bug where the timer would be off by 1 second (If the timer was set for 25 minutes, the alarm 
                would ring at 0:01 instead of 0:00). Our team decided that if the user chooses a time, to start the timer 1 second earlier so that the 
                timer would end at 0:00 (if the timer was set for 25 minutes, to change the timer text to 24:59 on start)</li>
            </ul>

            <b>Feature Update:</b> In our original design, our team decided not to implement a task list feature and focus solely on the timer aspect, however, 
            from user testing, a few comments we received was that the task list is considered a core feature of a Pomodoro Timer, therefore our team 
            decided to implement it. Additionally, it was brought to our attention that there should be a guide to show users how to use the different 
            features on the Pomodoro Timer Web Application.

          <p><br><b>Reflection/Lessons learned</b> - From this project, I learned a lot about teamwork and communication. Our team was 
            composed of designers and programmers but one of the most important aspects was bridging the communication gap 
            between the Design team and the Coding team to make sure everyone understood what the future plans are and what 
            goals should be accomplished before a certain deadline.</p>

          <br><b>Future Plans: </b>If there was more time, some future features to think about would address more user accessibility. During the project,
          our team tried to address most of the user accessibility issues as outlined by Google Lighthouse but as you can see below, there
          can be more improvement:
